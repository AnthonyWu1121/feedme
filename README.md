# FeedMe

## Overview
Over a third of all food produced ($\approx$ 2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year.\footnote{\href{https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/global-food-waste-in-2022}{https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/global-food-waste-in-2022}} Take a look at our daily life. Expired foods are thrown away everyday. Those foods and ingredients had been kept in the fridge, been forgotten, and never been used, mostly because we don't know how to use them. 

FeedME -- a revolutionary system, combining both fridge managing system and recipe platform, increases the convenience for users to cook delicious meals with minimum food waste. With FeedME, users can create an account to share extraordinary cuisine, keep track of ingredients in their fridge and explore recommended recipes.

We believe FeedME would bring a better tomorrow for all humankind.
